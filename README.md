This software will scan for COVID vaccine appointments.

Pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens don't have a waitlist or queue system for the COVID vaccine. I don't want my mom to have to deal with constantly refreshing the pharmacy websites to check for open appointments.

## Getting Started

- Install Node.js v14
- Rename the `privateConfig-example.js` file to just `privateConfig.js`.
- Edit the `privateConfig.js` file with your own personal info.
- Run `npm i` in a terminal to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` in a terminal to start the scanner.
